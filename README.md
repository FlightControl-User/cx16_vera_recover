# cx16_vera_recover
A nice way to recover your Commander X16 VERA using an Arduino Nano ESP32

With this code I could recover my own CX16 VERA using an Arduino Nano ESP32.
I don't wish anyone to brick their VERA but with this tool you can recover.

The process how to do this will be documented here.
